# Ancient Scrolls
## Description
- A completely server-side Minecraft mod developed entirely using
the Bukkit, Spigot, PaperMC and NMS application programming
interfaces.
- Adds perks and bonuses to the vanilla Minecraft survival
experience through items called "Ancient Scrolls". These scrolls
can be equipped by the player to receive powers and bonuses.
- Currently, this plugin only runs on Paper 1.21.8 servers.
- An API is provided by the plugin which allows developers to
create custom scrolls in their own plugins.
- This plugin is in beta and bugs are to be expected. Besides
that, it is very stable. Please report any mechanical bugs to the
issues page.
